# Architecture

The simulation is built in layers. Information flows downward from operator intent to agent
decisions, and **sideways only through the comms graph**.

```
operator.py   (planned)  objective  ->  initial priors / task weights
      |
agent.py      (planned)  one drone: belief, decision, motion.  Sees: own sensor + its inbox
      |                                         ^
comms.py      who can talk to whom, delivery  --+   (range, weights, delay; later dropouts, LOS)
      |
consensus.py  pure math: local update rule, Laplacians, spectra, bounds
      |
world.py      (planned)  ground truth, target, sensor model
sim.py        loop, events, metrics, scenario runners
viz.py        figures (optional)
```

## Module responsibilities

| module | status | owns | must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config.py` | done | the `Config` dataclass and YAML loading | contain logic |
| `comms.py` | done | `CommsGraph`, unit-disk links, `a_ij`, `deliver()` | know about beliefs or tasks |
| `consensus.py` | done | `consensus_step()` and analysis (L, Lhat, spectrum, alpha, tau_max) | hold state or draw random numbers |
| `sim.py` | done (step 1) | the time loop, delay buffer, metrics, `SCENARIOS` registry | let an agent read another agent's state |
| `viz.py` | done (step 1) | plots | be imported by core modules |
| `operator.py` | planned | turning an objective into priors | |
| `world.py` | planned | ground truth and noisy observations | |
| `agent.py` | planned | per-drone belief update and policy | |

## Data flow in one step (step 1)

1. Every drone broadcasts its current value. The broadcast history is the delay buffer.
2. `comms.deliver(g, i, sent)` gives drone i the list `[(a_ij, x_j(t - tau)) for j in N_i]`.
3. `consensus.consensus_step()` updates x_i from that inbox and the drone's own memory.

## Browser demos (`tools/`)

`consensus_lab.html` and `mission1_evacuation.html` are standalone prototypes. They follow the same
rules (agents only use their own sensing and messages), but they are not built on the Python package.
In Mission 1, the JavaScript sections map onto the planned modules as follows: the ground-truth grid
and survivors (`world.py`), knowledge, allocation and behaviours (`agent.py`), links and the hop-by-hop
merge (`comms.py`), and priorities (`operator.py`). See
[ADR 0002](decisions/0002-mission1-browser-prototype.md). `tests/test_tools_html.py` runs static
checks on every demo.

## Adding a scenario

1. Write `run_<name>(cfg) -> Result` in `sim.py` (or a new module) and register it in `SCENARIOS`.
2. Add any new parameters to `Config` with defaults, then add `configs/<name>.yaml`.
3. Add tests, and an ADR if the design choice is significant.
